## test current configurations
1. copy demo.tts.py into the project previously created
2. search and open "pycharm-community" from start menu
3. open the project previously created
4. run the demo.tts.py to get the results

Notes for "demo.tts.py" script:
1. the "os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK']='True'" line added is aiming to
   prevent the "duplicated libiomp5md.dll" error. This is an upstream conda design error for
   Windows system (no such error for Linux) and has no fundamental solutions for this yet.
2. we could change the line "device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu""
   into "device = "cpu" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"" if the GPU memory size is
   not sufficient.
3. a "plt.show()" line is added after "plt.imshow(spec[0].cpu().detach())" to actually show
   the figure, and we need to close the figure to continue running the script.
4. when "unexpected EOF, expected xxxxx more bytes. The file might be corrupted." occurs,
   set "force_reload=True" temporarily for the "waveglow = torch.hub.load" command, to
   re-download the waveglow model
5. the ipython output relies on jupyter notebook environment which is not setup for now.
   If we need the jupyter notebook environment, the following link could be used as reference:
